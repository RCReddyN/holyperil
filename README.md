<p> I have seen enough science-fiction movies involving space, stars and other stellar objects. Most of which, accidentally, happen to be written around an asteroid on a collison course to Earth. This project is inspired from the same.</p>

<ul>
<li> Holyperil is a command-line application written in Python.<li> The application warns us of potentially dangerous asteroids approaching Earth, six days in advance.
<li> Why six days? Six days, so that you could prepare, for how to deal with the impending potential catastrophe on the seventh day.
</ul>
